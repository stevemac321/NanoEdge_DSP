## ‚öôÔ∏è DSP Project: Multi-Signal NanoEdge‚Ñ¢ AI Outlier Detection

**CMSIS-DSP ¬∑ Embedded Inference ¬∑ STM32F401RE ¬∑ Reusable Buffers**

This project demonstrates real-time outlier detection on an STM32F401RE using a NanoEdge‚Ñ¢-trained outlier model. It streams live sensor data, applies lightweight DSP preprocessing, and runs inference‚Äîall under severe memory constraints. NOTE: the files beginning with "_" can be renamed to "." e.g. .cproject, github does not by default accept "." files perceives them as hidden.

Key features:

- üìâ CMSIS-DSP processing on actual MCU signals
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Reusable buffer architecture to reduce SRAM usage
- üîí `const`-qualified inference data in Flash (bypassing `.data` overflows)
- üß† NanoEdge‚Ñ¢ AI multi-signal outlier detection
- ‚ö° Multiple execution modes for development, data generation, and deployment

### üì° Signal Sources & Processing Techniques

Each signal contributes a dimension to the outlier model. They‚Äôre derived from live hardware measurements or synthetic runtime metrics:

| Signal Source                         | Processing Techniques                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Voltage (from ADC)**                | FFT, filtering, RMS, envelope (CMSIS-DSP)       |
| **Temperature (internal sensor)**     | Averaging, FIR/IIR smoothing                    |
| **CPU Load** (cycle counter/systick)  | Trend analysis, moving average                  |
| **RAM Usage** (heap/stack monitor)    | Threshold detection, low-pass filter            |
| **Power Draw** (via shunt or Vref)    | Smoothing, transient detection, RMS             |
| **MCU Core Temp**                     | Windowed smoothing, baseline deviation          |
| **Loop Time / Jitter**                | Stddev, FFT for noise profiling                 |
| **UART Traffic**                      | Idle time analysis, packet rate histogram       |
| **ADC Noise Floor** (idle)            | FFT fingerprinting                              |
| **Internal Clock Drift**              | Time-domain deltas, outlier detection           |

> **Note on Signal Structure:**  
> In this project, each signal type (e.g. voltage, temperature, power draw) created the NanoEdge model (lib) with 5-6 signal inputs located in the "signals" directory.
> the currently checked in lib does not use the commbined signal file "signal_clean.txt. Not sure adding would help or confuse.

### üîÅ Execution Modes (controlled by conditional compilation).

| Mode              | Purpose                                           | Signal Handling                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `DSP_MODE`        | Visualize signals & DSP pre-processing            | Per-signal, printed to UART     |
| `SIGNAL_FORMAT`   | Generate rows for training                        | One signal at a time            |
| `INFERENCE_TEST`  | Run inference on fixed dataset                    | Full multi-signal array         |
| `SELF_DIAG_MODE`  | Live inference with minimal output                | One active signal per run       |




#### üîπ Mode 1: **Verbose DSP Logging**
**When:** `DSP_TEST` is **defined** in `dsp_test.h`  
**Purpose:** Development & debugging  
**Behavior:**
- Logs full signal outputs via `printf`
- Can include raw ADC snapshots, FFT bin magnitudes, and jitter measurements

---

#### üî∏ Mode 2: **Signal Capture for Training**
**When:** `SIGNAL_FORMAT` is **defined**  
**Purpose:** Create datasets for NanoEdge AI Studio  
**Behavior:**
- Each row = one time window with 128 elements
- Outputs plain text rows (float or integer)
- Suited for collecting hundreds of rows to train the outlier model

---

#### üß† Mode 3: **Inference Mode**
**Purpose:** Real-time outlier detection  
**Behavior:**
- Uses NanoEdge‚Äôs `neai_oneclass()` on incoming signals
- Prints classification result, row index, and outlier flag
- Processes up to 495 rows of inference data with only ~512B RAM footprint
